## Abstract 
![](assets/sel_img.png)

In this paper, we propose a framework that leverages semi-supervised models to improve unsupervised clustering performance. To leverage semi-supervised models, we first need to automatically generate labels, called pseudo-labels. We find that prior approaches for generating pseudo-labels hurt clustering performance because of their low accuracy. Instead, we use an ensemble of deep networks to construct a similarity graph, from which we extract high accuracy pseudo-labels. The approach of finding high quality pseudo-labels using ensembles and training the semi-supervised model is iterated, yielding continued improvement. We show that our approach outperforms state of the art clustering results for multiple image and text datasets. For example, we achieve 54.6% accuracy for CIFAR-10 and 43.9% for 20news, outperforming state of the art by 8-12% in absolute terms.




## Usage


### Dependencies
* Python 2/3
* Keras 2.1.4
* Tensorflow 1.15.0 
* Sklearn 0.20.4

*Note that due to changes in Sklearn, version > 0.20.4 will result in wrong calculation of clustering accuracy.*


### Training

```python
from kingdra_cluster.kingdra_cluster import KingdraCluster
model = KingdraCluster()
model.fit( X )
# API documentation coming soon
```


### Evaluating 
```python
from kingdra_cluster.unsup_metrics import ACC
preds = model.predict( X )
ACC( gt  ,  preds )
```
